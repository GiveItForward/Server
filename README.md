How to read our API. Each API call is defined by a path which may or may not consist of multiple headers. To read this API you simply must understand the structure of the path, headers, and description. Each call is separated by a bullet point. The first line is the path for the API call. The second line is the headers (if any) and the next line is a short description of what the call does. The final line is the return value (if any).

#### External API:
